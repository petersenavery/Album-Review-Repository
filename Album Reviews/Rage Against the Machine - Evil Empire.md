# Rage Against the Machine - Evil Empire
## Review by Avery Petersen
Apple Music's description of this album compares Rage Against the Machine to an expert bomb squad, and there is no better descriptor. They had an unstable and downright radioactive energy coming into their first album, and with Evil Empire, they refined it into the atom bomb.

Evil Empire is poetic, yet often in your face. The intricacies of the guitar work rival works of Sonic Youth, Radiohead, etc., while commenting on territory very few bands dared to touch. While System of a Down used Toxicity to focus on political and governing issues - Something Rage still does, of course - Evil Empire goes beyond that, investigating the surveillance state we live in, the media that controls us, and the brainwashing our government employs to cover up their misdoings.

Overall this album is beyond stellar, with absolutely no track worth missing.
