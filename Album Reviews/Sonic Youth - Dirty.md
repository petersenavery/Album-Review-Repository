# Sonic Youth - Dirty
## Album Review by Avery Petersen
Sonic Youth are a band that I often neglected. I viewed them as I viewed many other popular bands with my generation - flash over substance. I think modern media platforms have a way of skewing or even preventing people from experiencing certain bands for the fear of hopping on a bandwagon. Well, bandwagon be damned - I'm hopping on Sonic Youth.

Sonic Youth's first album has always had a place on my playlist, though never a band I'd consider a favorite. That was until I listened to Dirty.

Dirty is, well, dirty. The guitar work is otherworldly. Sonic Youth often produces riffs that are mindboggling, sometimes surpassing the idea of what a guitar can do. Their music comes alive, and on Dirty, an emotion so strong, so severe, comes out to dance. 

It seems that many have mixed things to say about Dirty, a notion that more than confuses me. It is hard to put into words how emotional this album feels. Tracks like '100%' are angry, all over the place, while tracks like 'Wish Fulfillment' are dreamy, yet calculated. 

I admit that it is hard to listen to Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore drone over some otherwise fantastic instrumentals. For example, on 'Swimsuit Issue' the band comes ripping out of the stables, only for Gordon's lackluster vocals to drown out the intense sound. Still, I find myself coming back regardless. Their instrumental control is *that* good.
