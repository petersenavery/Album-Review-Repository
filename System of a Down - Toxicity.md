## Review by Avery Petersen
I have had a recent interest in politically charged albums. Enter: Toxicity. 
Some artists are subtle, while SOAD is anything but. Never missing a beat, each song is electrifying, commenting on massive social and cultural issues in America. It's almost hard to say this album is 'commenting' on anything - comment doesn't quite describe it. Instead, SOAD bluntly puts it as it is. 'Prison Song' discusses the major issues facing America's prison system, and how our lawmakers seem to know that rehabilitation works, yet they continue to support a system that only locks people away, introducing new ways everyday to put more Americans behind bars. 'Psycho' depicts the so-called groupies of Hollywood and the drug use of bands and their followers. The album can be almost silly at times, and holds itself to no standards, but it is angry, messy, and speaks volumes to its own content.
